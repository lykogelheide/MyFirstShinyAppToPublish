# MyFirstShinyAppToPublish
This is part of a course of my masters degree. Here I will host the code for a Shiny App to be published.

In this Shiny App, I used official data from Eurostat to create a time series of total immigration for the EU countries. You can decide which countries should be displayed by choosing the two-letter-codes for the country. Additionally, you can change for which years the data should be shown.
